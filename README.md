# ioc-calc
A simple index of coincidence calculator

The index of coincidence is an indicator used in cryptanalysis which makes it possible to evaluate the global distribution of letters in encrypted message for a given alphabet.

In simple terms, index of coincidence is a tool for measuring how statistically "rough" a text is, i.e. how far it departs from a uniform distribution in which all letters are equally likely.

## Implementation

### Python

The calculation can be done in the commandline via accessing `code.py`. You can calculate IoCs of messages upto a sentence in here(without new lines).

### GUI

A web based solution is also available by opening the `index.html` in your browser. This can be used to calculate IoCs of multiple sentences and texts such as poems and stuff...
